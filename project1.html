        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p> This is a rudimentary C++ executable I designed in my first semester to convert between different formats to aid with schoolwork. 
            I implemented basic and repetetive arithemtic operations to convert between any two formats.
            The required input is the number to be converted along with the current and desired format. 
            The conversion from binary decimal is staright forward. Each digit is converted separately then summed together to obtain the final result. 
            However each hex conversion is done in sets of 4 digits where each set is converted to decimal first then it is converted to hex through a pre-set index. 
            This works becasuse each binary set of four has a maximum value of 15. 
            The decimal to hex conversion is also fairly straight forward; I simply divide by 16 till the quotient is smaller than 16, then convert to hex based on the same index. 
            Repeat this process till the quotient is no longer divisible by 16.
            These processes done on reverse order give me the conversion for hex to binary and hex to decimal respectively.

        <h3> Features </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Select any format to begin with, hex/binary/decimal in input. </li>
            <li> Select any format to convert into. </li>
            <li> keep track of result for further conversion. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Limitations </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Each conversion is done arithmetically which might be wasting processing time and computing resources. Could be imporved using pre defined functions. </li>
        </ul>
